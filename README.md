# Home Loan Optimizer

Owning a home is always an amazing feeling! However, planning the settlement of your home loan in a way that, it is optimally beneficial to you is very important. Home loan does help us save taxes and at the same time it also results in high interests to be paid over a period of time. It is not recommended to prepay the home loan from other funds as one might need that additional funds for something else in life like kid's education, wedding, medical emergency, etc. So, it is not recommended to give away the additional funds that one has to the bank just to reduce interest. 

So, there has to be a way where 
- the borrower avails decent tax benefits
- pays significantly lower interest than the original plan 
- at the same time keep the additional funds with oneself which may be utilised for some other event of life
- also utilize the saved interest to invest in some other instrument to create more wealth

_**This objective can be achieved by simply increasing the EMIs by a certain percentage every year!**_

This project is aimed at recommending you with strategies to achieve the above objective and also provide you with calcuations so that you can arrive at a decision of what suits you the best and increase your EMI by that certain percentage accordingly!
